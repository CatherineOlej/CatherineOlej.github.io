# **The meaning behind the Illustration** 

The goal here is to promote a product, along with a deeper meaning that demonstrates perspective. I used my skills in image manipulation in order to make the layout aesthetically pleasing and to support my goals.

\*\*\*\*The product advertised in this creation is the virtual reality headset. I figured that adding a deeper meaning aside would draw more attention and curiosity; to make it more interesting. When it comes to art, _a picture is worth a thousand words -_ conveying the complex idea into a picture. Virtual reality is growing in today’s society, and this is where my attempt to demonstrate perspective comes in.

 A very common question we tend to be unclear of answering is, “How do we see our future?” In deep thought, we paint a picture of it. I found that this idea could define perspective on how we view the future. The dry brush effect applied to the image of the earth behind the VR headset background represents our world. That effect makes the image somewhat blurry, which correlates to our future, unclear. Virtual reality is set in a fantasy world, but what happens if it becomes a reality? The text in the portrait, “Can you see it now?” questions those looking through the headset, if they can see their future world inside that virtual one. Ours may be unclear, since we will encounter many obstacles. However, could this one take a toll towards a possibility of seeing it clearer? In the essence to support this theory, the images play an important role with a significant meaning to each. 

Wherever you go, reality follows the rules of opposites: positive and negative, good and evil, night and day, on and off, etc., because one cannot exist without the other. That is what the binary background represents in this scene, as if the universe was programmed in a binary sort of code. Even though that may not be true, it provides a theme. Each rounded image is masked within an eclipse shape; resized, image traced, filtered and reduced opacity to add onto the effect. The two images at the top show one of the two possible outcomes of what the world may look like in the future. It either can be a disaster or technologically advanced. There is no doubt that the technological industry will ever stop growing. Innovation is a means to human intelligence and development, but it is up to humanity to choose an outcome. Humanity is questing its own existence in the future. If we stand a chance with the pursuit of AI and the perception on whether robots will take over or not. I used the image of a human hand making contact with a robotic one to define it. The clock was purposely set to the back unlike the rest of the pictures. The reason for that is that “time” works behind the scenes. We wouldn’t typically consider that part, but it represents the matter of time that occurs for such events to transpire. Only time can tell. 

Everything you see in this portrait is linked together in order to interpret perspective. By looking hardly through the headset, can you see your future? This illustrates a metaphor to describe ourselves, as to how portray this topic, while simultaneously promoting the virtual reality product and mastering the technical details. That is how this artwork helps achieve my goals.

**Feedback:**  

> "You put a great deal of thought into Part B and it shows in the results. The issue of uncertainty about the future combined with the role technology must play in it is a huge one and your artwork captures those sentiments beautifully."
