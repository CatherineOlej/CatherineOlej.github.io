What is it?

Enigma’s Box is an “escape room” themed game where players are locked in a room. Players will be encouraged to use cooperation and their problem-solving skills to solve riddles to uncover the clues and tools needed to escape the room before the timer is up. 

The app is a way for players to register for games which usually are themed. Therefore, a player can register themselves and up to six people for a particular event that is of more interest to them.
