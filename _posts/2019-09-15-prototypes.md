  In this post you will find a few prototypes that I've done in my Graphics
  Techniques for Illustration course. I am only sharing projects I think would
  be most appealing and interesting to my viewers.

# H.I.V.E

The product the artwork intends to promote is artificial intelligence in a virtual reality type of world. The purpose of this is to combine human knowledge and computerized data to work together in a virtual reality, so it does not completely take over human labor. Virtual reality is rising in the world and applying artificial intelligence will become the next possible innovation in the virtual world.  This is why we perceive it more as a virtual intelligence.

## **Textural Techniques employed:**

The textural techniques employed were geometrical patterns, brush effects combined texture filling effects (bevel & emboss, stroke, inner shadow, color overlay, outer glow), images, as well as a slightly transparent background.

## **How these techniques support my promotion:**

The proper use of images, opacity tool, color and background elevates the idea of what service would be delivered. Including text in the layout is important in the sense that it gives meaning to the web page and an understanding of what to achieve. The geometric patterns that were used appeal more meaning to our brand. The color filled into the “hive” drawing, designed by the geometric pattern, will give the impression of “honey”, “bees”, as every hive would. This is because it promotes to establish the new connection of humans and artificial intelligence working together to excel in the future. This is why the “hive” provides an idea for the intended promotion. 

It not only displays a network of a constructive relationship, but the way the nature of bees function is how it correlates to the topic of the layout. The idea behind the logo was to include the different types of users out there: visual and verbal. The opacity effect plays a major role in promotion, since each image does not shoot out aggressively in the eyes of the users. Instead, it is more subtle and gains more attention and curiosity. Another motive as to why the color blue was chosen to promote this product is for the reason that technology gives a feeling that artificial intelligence, robotics, computers etc., relate to the colors blue, green, and white. 

In the header, the “register tab” will allow users to create an account to have access to their own “virtual machine.” This will come at a price of course if people will want to have their own personal robot in a virtual world, but this  will mainly be for business and governmental use purposes. 

HIVE stands for Highly Intelligent Virtual Enterprise. This introduces artificial intelligence into the virtual world as the innovative hybrid, which combines both human and computerized brilliance into bringing a balance to the future. This means that people will still have the opportunity to work and not completely be taken over by machines.

# **The Brush Effect**

The goal presented in this artwork is an advertised example directed at the car community as a sample for those interested to have their cars turned into a stylish wallpaper image. This wallpaper can be in the form of a computer desktop, screen saver, cellphone background picture, or a printed copy to hang on the wall. Many car enthusiasts out there dedicate a lot of time, money, and work modifying their cars that satisfies the eyes of others, as well as their own. When one feels as if their car has been completed to their expectations, they take a series of photos or video montages of their car to share with the world. This artwork is an example of how the image of someone car can be transformed to look astounding to the eye

# **The Mosaic Effect**

The goal for the self-taken images is to present the mosaic effect. They were used to make a background as an advertisement for personal photography. The logo resembles a camera and inside the lens part of it are my initials, “KO”. The “photography” text adds more insight to the presentation, therefore making “Catherine’s Photography.” I figured that it would be an appropriate idea to put them towards good use to fictionally of self-advertise.
