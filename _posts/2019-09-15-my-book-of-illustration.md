**What is it about?**

The images help describe the quotes literally, but have a meaning behind it. The style that keeps each illustration connected is the spirit animal, which is a hawk. The hawk teaches awareness. A way to see the bigger picture. I felt that the symbolic meaning of the hawk was an appropriate choice considering that “perspective” is important in art.

**How my techniques support the concept**

* The orange glow represents the spirit illusion 
* The actual color represents encouragement, change, determination and expression
* I just liked the text font
* The text font is Bank Gothic Lt BT with additional effects like stroke and drop shadow (orange glow sized nine, spread 46%)

# **Lets begin!**

This illustration describes how everyone has a different path or calling in life. The reason for it being incomplete is because we decide our density. How the end of the road will look like is down to ourselves.

## Self-Reflection

 Don’t be a passenger in your life. Focus on what will make you happy.

* The hawk will appear in every picture now 
* The quotes are from the hawk 
* Its a way of showing awareness

## Perspective

This form of perspective uses the point-of-view from the ground. This demonstrates the failure and the hawk doesn't want you to give up.

## Self-Reflect

* Gradient around the image is like the camera lens 
* The colors resemble a positive and negative output on life 
* You hold the power in what you envision

Reflect a life of joy and progress?

Reflect a lens of fear?

Reflect a lens of courage?

Reflect a lens of love?
